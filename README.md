# Dalibor's Resume Project

For propper function you need to have Node.JS installed.
Download this package and run npm install under /Resume folder.
After that there is a webpack configuration, which can be run with npm run build for production, or npm run dev for development. 
Either of those creates static files under wwwroot directory (production creates only minified versions).
Then just run the application with launch profiles "DEV" or "PROD".
